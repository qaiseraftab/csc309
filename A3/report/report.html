    <h3 class="heading">Problem statement </h3>
        <p>Canada has a diverse community and few countries in the world have 
            larger porportion of immigrants than Canada. By 2017, around 22% of population in Canada will be 
            foreign born. It is becoming increasing hard for people to make friends and socialize. Facebook 
            and other social media networks allow us to keep in touch with our friends but the goal of social media sites is not 
            to help us make new friends.  
            House Party Finder will allow hosts to advertise their house parties while people who want to
            socialize will be able to find house parties. Unlike club events, there is no platform to advertise 
            house parties. 
        </p>
    <h3 class="heading">The solution</h3>
        <p>via house party finder website, party host will be able advertise their parties, upload pictures and live stream their
            parties. Users will be able to search for parties in their area and rate the parties. Parties with very high ratings
            will be showcased under 'featured parties' on homepage to give them more exposure.<br />
            Using house party finder, people will be able to interact with others with similar interests and make new friends in the 
            same city.    
        </p>

    <p>I am 4th year student, studying Computer Science and English with a main focus on game design and UX.
        In this project, I worked on UX design, databases and backend processing. 
         <br /> <br />
        In this course I learned many things, I started the course with knowledge in HTML5, MySQL, PHP, Javascript/JQuery and CSS. In the end 
        I learned how to code better in HTML5, CSS, Javascript/JQuery, and learned how to use Nodejs, and Ruby.
        It was also good to get a remind on how to use GIT again.

        I am 4th year computer science student, specializing in web development.
        In this project, I worked on website prototyping, UX design and backend processing. I was also responsible for
        integrating code (from other members), checking and fixing errors, and migrating the project to Ruby on Rails
        for assignment 3.

        Feedback: "During this course, I gained further experience working with Node.js in a web-based environment. I also
        learned how to lead and assist development of a short-term project."
