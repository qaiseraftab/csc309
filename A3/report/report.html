    <h3 class="heading">Problem statement </h3>
        <p>Canada has a diverse community and few countries in the world have 
            larger porportion of immigrants than Canada. By 2017, around 22% of population in Canada will be 
            foreign born. It is becoming increasing hard for people to make friends and socialize. Facebook 
            and other social media networks allow us to keep in touch with our friends but the goal of social media sites is not 
            to help us make new friends.  
            House Party Finder will allow hosts to advertise their house parties while people who want to
            socialize will be able to find house parties. Unlike club events, there is no platform to advertise 
            house parties. 
        </p>
    <h3 class="heading">The solution</h3>
        <p>via house party finder website, party host will be able advertise their parties, upload pictures and live stream their
            parties. Users will be able to search for parties in their area and rate the parties. Parties with very high ratings
            will be showcased under 'featured parties' on homepage to give them more exposure.<br />
            Using house party finder, people will be able to interact with others with similar interests and make new friends in the 
            same city.    
        </p>

    <h3>Andrew (Moo Sun) Lee</h3>
    <img src="faces/andrew.jpg" style="float: left; width: 150px; padding-right: 15px;" />
    <p>I am 4th year student, studying Computer Science and English with a main focus on game design and UX.
        In this project, I worked on UX design, databases and backend processing. 
         <br /> <br />
        In this course I learned many things, I started the course with knowledge in HTML5, MySQL, PHP, Javascript/JQuery and CSS. In the end 
        I learned how to code better in HTML5, CSS, Javascript/JQuery, and learned how to use Nodejs, and Ruby.
        It was also good to get a remind on how to use GIT again.

    <p>
        I am 4th year computer science student, specializing in web development.
        In this project, I worked on website prototyping, UX design and backend processing. I was also responsible for
        integrating code (from other members), checking and fixing errors, and migrating the project to Ruby on Rails
        for assignment 3.
        <br /> <br />

        Feedback: "During this course, I gained further experience working with Node.js in a web-based environment. I also
        learned how to lead and assist development of a short-term project."

    <p>
        I am 4th year Electrical and Computer Engineering student. My interests include app development and entrepreneurship. 
        In this project, I worked on idea generation, front end design and live streaming.
        <br /><br />
        In this course I learned new frameworks such as node.js, mongo db, HTML5 and CSS3 features. It was a great experience
        to begin with an idea and build something useful.

    <p>
        Richard Luu is a 2nd year student in the Computer Science Specialist program, entering 3rd year in the fall.
        In this project, he worked on UX design, backend processing and error fixing. He was also largely responsible for
        communicating and cordinating tasks among team members.

        <br /> <br />
        In this course I learned many things, I entered the course with knowledge in HTML5, MySQL and some CSS knowledge. In the end 
        I learned how to code in HTML5, CSS, Javascript/JQuery, Nodejs, and Ruby. It was also a great experience working my second

	<h2 class="heading">Description of what has been done</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Users are able to register and login into their accounts.</li>
		<li>Party hosts can upload information about parties.</li>
		<li>Users can search parties.</li>
		<li>Hosts can live stream their parties.</li>
		<li>Users can see similar parties to the one they are looking at.</li>
		<li>Addresses are verified with Google API.</li>
		<li>Users can rate parties.</li>
		
		
	</ul>
	
	<h2 class="heading">Performance testing</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>The server worked fine on Richard's laptop until around 5000 concurrent requests where it started to produce errors.</li>
		<li>At 5000 the error percentage was about 9% and at 10000 the error percentage was about 40%. </li>
		<li>The server error production was scaling exponentially and not linearly. We want to fix it so that it scaled linearly.</li>
		<li>We tried using Rack::Deflater/gzip/racky-zippy to compress the files so that pages can load fast. 
			However it wasn't compressing the files properly.</li>
		<li>So then we tried load balancing the server with 5 differents port for our server Thin on Ruby on Rails but 
			the requests kept coming back to localhost:3000.</li>
		<li>In the end we were unable to fix the performance/scalability of the server to linear instead of exponential.</li>
		<li>Error percentage at 5000 concurrent requests <br /><img src="performance/5000.png"/></li>
		<li>Error percentage at 10000 concurrent requests <br /><img src="performance/5000.png"/></li>
	</ul>
	
	<h2 style="clear:both" class="heading">Actions to secure the website</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Bcrypt hashing was used for passwords.</li>
		<li>Users are restricted to access certain pages that they do not own.</li>
		<li>Google API address verfication.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h2 style="clear:both" class="heading">Flaws and limitations</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>It is possible to hijack the stream of a user and we want to add a password to secure the stream (e.g.: http://127.0.0.1:8082/secret/).</li>
	
	</ul>
