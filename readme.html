<u><b>What has been done: </b></u><br>
	The main front-end has been done, and they have been linked to their appropriate pages.<br>
	The pages should adjust to the screen size, and therefore should work on different platforms<br>
	without too much problem unless the screen is extremely small.<br>
	We chose blue, grey and white color scheme as those colors do not strain the eye, and allow<br>
	the users to browse through parties for a long time without effort.<br>
<br>
<u><b>Who did what:</b></u><br>
	<b>Andrew Moo Sun Lee</b> - Worked on Log-in, Register, Search results page, and took part with Dickson in<br>
	                     removing tables from original pages using Dickson's new templates, this file.<br>
	<br>
	<b>Qaiser Aftab</b> - Worked on original template, that included the header, footer, and basically, the homepage.<br>
						  Additionally, the original individual party page, terms of use, privacy policy and site map <br>
						  were his work.<br>
	<br>
	<b>Dickson Law</b> - Responsible for updating the website template to use a table-free design<br>
						 and fixing CSS irregularities. Additionally worked on featured parties page, <br>
	<br>
	<b>Richard Luu</b> - Responsible for live stream page, hosting party page and half of the searching page, and<br>
						 fixing links at final stages of the assignment, and my parties page. <br>

	<br><br>
	<b>Note:</b> the term "original" refers to our original design that included tables, in which the professor, later said that <br>
	tables should not be used, and had to be re-done.
