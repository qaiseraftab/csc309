What has been done:
	The main front-end has been done, and they have been linked to their appropriate pages.
	The pages should adjust to the screen size, and therefore should work on different platforms
	without too much problem unless the screen is extremely small.
	We chose blue, grey and white color scheme as those colors do not strain the eye, and allow
	the users to browse through parties for a long time without effort.

Who did what:
	Andrew Moo Sun Lee - Worked on Log-in, Register, Search results page, and took part with Dickson in
	                     removing tables from original pages using Dickson's new templates
	
	Qaiser Aftab - Worked on original template (not included in project), 
	
	Dickson Law - Dickson was responsible for updating the website template to use a table-free design
				  and fixing CSS irregularities
	
	Richard Luu -
